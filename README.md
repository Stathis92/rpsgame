# rpsgame
Rock Paper Scissors

This is the third project of TOP

In this project we get introduced into javascript.

For starters we want to build a basic game with some console inputs/outputs instead of UI.

Later on we will revisit this project and finish it up with some 
user interface.

Best of luck to future me and to everyone doing this!
